# Vilnius real estate used Apartment market analysis

* Purpose: analyse Vilnius real estate pricing changes during Covid-19 induced quarantine and post-quarantine period (est. 2020.05-2020.12)
* Hypothesis: The uncertainty brought by Covid-19 should bring fluctuations in Vilnius real estate markets.
* Predictions:
  1. Increase in supply for apartments selling due to short-term rent demand drop and potential purchases hesitation due to market changes.
  2. Decrease in prices due to plummeting demand and potential increase of supply.

* Scope: data from one of main the Lithuanian real estate market portals used.
* Data loaded weekly to monitor market changes.
* New apartments (year > 2019) are excluded from analysis as only partial data of their full supply and pricing are  available.
* only furnished apartments are included in the analysis.  
### Weak points
* The apartments being sold data is available from April. A better picture would have been having the data from as early as January.
* The apartments being rented data is available from May. A better picture would also require early data, such as start of 2020.
* Spikes in weeks' data possible. Preferred way would be to load data daily and smooth out edges with weekly averages. Daily scrapping is out of scope owever.
* Data is based on posts and not actual objects in the market. There exists a practice of same object(apartment) postings in multiple districts (to make the object more visible and sell faster), that contributes to duplicate data. This duplicate data for the moment remains in dataset to support analysis splitting data into districts. 
* More sources could be included for analysis. This however can also result in duplicates.
